        <blockquote> <br> <p style="border:5px solid chocolate;"> There are many things I had experienced and want to learn more. The first thing that I had learn is cooking. 
        The number of things I can make in the kitchen is limited. However, while making those things, I realize the happiness and satisfaction are get from cooking. 
        One of the cuisines I want to learn correctly is <i> Arab </i> food. We must always check the 180 <sup> celcius </sup> in our food when put it in the oven. 
        It’s a cuisine that I have started loving, and knowing how to cook dishes in the kitchen will make me happy.</p> </br> </blockquote>

        <blockquote> <br> <p style="border: 5px dashed maroon;"> Almost everyone is kind at least one sport. The one competition that I am good at is <i> badminton </i>. 
            In my school, almost everyone had an obsession with the sport, and so did I. Every game period, my teacher would make us play badminton, along with other games. 
            Over the years, the way I played badminton improved, and while learning the game, I discovered other lessons as well. One of the lessons I’ve learned is not to give up. 
            I have always been energetic and lively. While many people feel awkward and weird, making me friends, I have no problems with making new friends. 
            I can talk to everyone quickly and know them.</p> </br> </blockquote>

        <blockquote> <br> <p style="border: 5px dotted olive;"> Recently, my family and I went on holiday in <i> Penang </i>. We stayed in a rented apartment as our stay during our stay in Penang.
             We visited various interesting places that were there. Among them is that we stopped at Deen Maju Restaurant, which is one of the most famous Nasi Kandar restaurant in Penang. 
             Next, we visited Kampung Agong where the place has a variety of interesting activities that can be done such as horseback riding, rickshaws and bicycles, strolling along the rice fields and taking pictures. 
             After that, we stopped at Medan Selera and enjoyed a meal of grilled fish by the sea. In the evening, we had a chance to visit Street Art to see the various art painted on the walls of each street alley and take pictures as memories. 
             After a tiring walk we rested at Padang Kota while enjoying the food sold there.</p> <br> </blockquote>
