         <br> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p style="background-color: burlywood;">Assalamualaikum and happy new year, my name is Nursyazwani Shahrom. You can call me Wawa, Wani or Weny. I'm 21 years old this year. I was born on 26 May 2001. My place of birth is in Hospital Kajang. My hobbie is watching k-drama and cooking.
           I like purple and red colour. I also love to sing. I live in Kajang, Selangor. I'm a fourth child in my family. I have 5 cats, 3 of them is a kitten. My cat name is Leo, Molly, Luca, Lucy and Baby. I don't have many friends but I love all of them. I'm so nervous because this is my first website that I created by myself.I also like to travel with family or friends. 
           During the ODL, many activities I do with the family such as picnics, cycling and walks in various places. I am a student in Uitm Rembau. My height is about 149cm and my weight is 50kg. I love cats and fish. I am introvert person but I love to travel. I love to wear comfort outfit when I go out. I study in <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi Mara Kampus Rembau" > Uitm Rembau </abbr> , Negeri Sembilan. I can talk in <font color="saddlebrown" face="lucida handwriting"> Japanese and Korean language </font>. While many people have dreams of becoming doctors and lawyers, I have always wanted to be a traveler. 
           I donâ€™t remember when I fell in love with traveling, but over the years, my passion for traveling has increased. Over the past few months, I have started living this dream, and it gives me so much joy.
           My parents have always supported my dreams and aspirations. According to them, the only way to achieve all your goals is to work very hard and never give up on them. They have never imposed themselves and demanded that any of their children become what they want us. 
           Instead, they wanted my siblings and me to choose careers and a life that will give us joy and stability.
